# Understanding Stocks and Bonds

## What are Stocks?

Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy shares, you essentially own a piece of that company. Stocks are also known as "equity" because they give shareholders ownership rights.

### Types of Stocks:

- **Common Stocks**: Owners have voting rights and may receive dividends
- **Preferred Stocks**: Owners have a higher claim on assets and earnings but typically no voting rights

## What are Bonds?

Bonds are debt securities issued by companies or governments to raise capital. When you buy a bond, you're lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of the principal when the bond matures.

### Types of Bonds:

- **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies
- **Government Bonds**: Issued by governments (e.g., Treasury bonds)
- **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by local governments or municipalities

## Risk and Return of Stocks vs. Bonds

- **Stocks**: Potential for high returns but higher volatility
- **Bonds**: Offer more stable returns but with lower growth potential
