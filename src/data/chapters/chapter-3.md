# Building Your First Portfolio

## Getting Started

Creating your first investment portfolio is an exciting step toward financial independence. This chapter will guide you through the process of building a well-balanced portfolio aligned with your goals.

### Before You Start

Before investing, ensure you have:

- An emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses
- Paid off high-interest debt
- Clear financial goals (retirement, education, etc.)
- An understanding of your risk tolerance

## Asset Allocation Basics

Asset allocation is the process of dividing your investments among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.

### Factors Influencing Asset Allocation:

1. **Time Horizon**: How long until you need the money
2. **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort level with market fluctuations
3. **Financial Goals**: What you're investing for
4. **Age**: Generally, younger investors can take more risk
