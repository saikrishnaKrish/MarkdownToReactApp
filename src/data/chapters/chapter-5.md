# Asset Allocation and Portfolio Management

## What is Asset Allocation?

Asset allocation refers to the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. The goal is to balance risk and return by diversifying investments according to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

### Types of Asset Classes:

- **Stocks (Equities)**: High growth potential with higher risk
- **Bonds (Fixed Income)**: Stable returns with lower risk
- **Cash Equivalents**: Safe, low return investments (e.g., money market funds)
- **Alternative Investments**: Real estate, commodities, and others

## The Importance of Asset Allocation

A well-constructed asset allocation strategy helps you:

- Manage risk
- Achieve long-term financial goals
- Adjust to changing market conditions
