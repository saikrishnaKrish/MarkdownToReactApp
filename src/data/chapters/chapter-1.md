## What is investing?

Investing is the act of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. It's about putting your money to work for you to potentially build wealth over time.

### Why should you invest?

- **Build wealth**: Compounding returns can help your money grow exponentially
- **Achieve financial goals**: Whether it's retirement, education, or a home purchase
- **Generate passive income**: Create additional income streams beyond your salary

There are many ways to invest your money, each with different levels of risk and potential return:

1. **Stocks**: Ownership shares in a company
